small game idea i had to get out of my system and to learn the godot game engine and gdscript. no i don't even remember/understand half of what i made. reading every single line of code soon to refresh mind.

i can't stress enough that you pay no mind to the scenes ðŸ’€ it is a mess.

you are a ball of fire on a rainy night (rain strength/level is determined by difficulty).

you'll be greeted by the main menu upon running the program:
- play
- instructions (how to play)
- quit

hitting play will open the difficulty menu, where you can choose the difficulty for your next game:
- light rain (easy)
- heavy rain (medium-hard)
- thunderstorm (heavier rain + lightning, harder?)

there you can play the game and dodge the rain. you have five lives and you get smaller with each life lost.

there is a timer on the upper right side during gameplay (minutes, seconds, milliseconds). unfortunately, progress/highscores aren't implemented yet; maybe soon. idk. maybe.

yeah. cheers.
